Hello, my name is Shanti Widiyawati. I am working for Ministry of Trade as Computer Personnel. My daily tasks are not related to Computer Personnel's job. The tasks are more into processing employment data and financial data. Employment evaluation process, pension application process, and tax billing are something I have to manage. Currently, I pursue my bachelor degree at Informatics Engineering Esa Unggul University.
